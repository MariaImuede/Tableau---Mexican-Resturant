## Problem Statement

The project aims to conduct a trend analysis of Mexican restaurant ratings using Tableau to gain insights into various aspects of dining experiences, including overall ratings, service quality, food quality, consumer demographics, restaurant franchises, cuisine preferences, and drinking levels.

### Steps followed 


Step 1: Open Tableau Desktop and connect to the dataset containing the Mexican restaurant ratings data.

Step 2: Once the data is connected, Tableau will display the data source tab. Review the data fields and their types to ensure they are correctly interpreted by Tableau.

Step 3: Navigate to the "Sheet" tab to start building visualizations. Drag and drop fields from the data pane onto the rows and columns shelves to create basic visualizations such as bar charts or line graphs.

Step 4: Customize the visualizations by adding additional fields to the "Color", "Size", or "Label" shelves to enhance the visual representation of the data. Apply filters to focus on specific aspects of the data or to drill down into details.

Step 5: Create calculated fields or use Tableau's built-in functions to perform calculations or transformations on the data. This can include calculating averages, percentages, or creating new categorical variables based on existing data.

Step 6: Use Tableau's dashboard feature to bring together multiple visualizations onto a single dashboard. Arrange the visualizations to tell a cohesive story and provide a comprehensive overview of the trends in Mexican restaurant ratings.

Step 7: Apply formatting and styling to the dashboard to improve readability and visual appeal. This can include adjusting colors, fonts, and sizes to match the desired aesthetic.

Step 8: Test the interactive functionality of the dashboard by interacting with the visualizations to ensure they respond dynamically to user inputs such as filters or selections.

Step 9: Review the dashboard and make any necessary adjustments to optimize clarity and usability. This can include refining the layout, adjusting visualizations, or adding explanatory text to provide context.

Step 10: Publish the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Public to share it with stakeholders or make it accessible to a wider audience. Ensure that appropriate permissions and access controls are set up to manage who can view or interact with the dashboard.

# Recommendations:

Diverse Cuisine Options: Consider adding diverse cuisine options to the menu to attract a wider range of customers. Offering a variety of dishes beyond Mexican cuisine can cater to different preferences and increase customer satisfaction.
